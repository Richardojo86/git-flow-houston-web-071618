Now it's time to delete the remote branch add-fireflies as it is now included in the master branch: git push origin :add-fireflies
VISUALIZATION
Just to review, this is the chronological order of this lab complete with a diagram of the branches:
branches
from master, create branch add-turtle
add turtle pic and caption to index.html
merge add-turtle into master, now master has tree and turtle pics
from master, create branch add-walrus
add walrus pic and caption
from master, create branch add-walrus-and-polar-bear
add polar bear pic and caption
merge add-walrus into add-walrus-and-polar-bear and fix merge conflicts - now branch has tree, turtle, polar bear, and walrus
"Lauren" makes branch add-fireflies off of master and adds an emoticon to the readme
add firefly pic and caption to add-firefly branch
merge add-firefly into master
Without looking at the diagram above, try and draw your own visualization. Take a picture of your work and add that image to the public/img/ folder. Title your drawing "drawing.png".
QUIZ TIME
From the master branch, replace the question marks in spec/comprehension_spec.rb with the answers. Every answer should be a string. To check your answers, run learn. (If you don't have the Learn gem installed, you'll need to do that first: gem install learn-co. If the gem command doesn't work, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby.) Once every test is passing, submit a pull request using your master branch.
EXTRA CREDIT
Merge add-walrus-and-polar-bear into master. Fix the merge conflicts and push the changes before deleting the local and remote add-walrus-and-polar-bear branches.
